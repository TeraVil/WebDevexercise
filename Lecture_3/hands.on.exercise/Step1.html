<p style="color:white;">A <strong>black cat</strong> is a domestic cat with black fur. 
    <br>They may be a specific breed, or a common domestic cat of no particular or mixed breed. 
    Most black cats have golden irises due to their high melanin pigment content. 
     <br>
    Black cats are the subject of myth, legend, and superstition. They are commonly associated with witches and bad luck, occasionally good luck, in various folklore.
    <br>
    The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 22 cat breeds that can come with solid black coats.
    The Bombay breed is exclusively black.
