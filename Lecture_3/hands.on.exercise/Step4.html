    <p class="new">A <strong>black cat</strong> is a domestic cat with black fur. 
        <br>They may be a specific breed, or a common domestic cat of no particular or mixed breed. 
        Most black cats have golden irises due to their high melanin pigment content. 
         <br>
        Black cats are the subject of myth, legend, and superstition. They are commonly associated with witches and bad luck, occasionally good luck, in various folklore.
        <br>
        The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 22 cat breeds that can come with solid black coats.
        The Bombay breed is exclusively black.
